/**
 * The decision behind `hooks/BashWriteGuard.hook.ts` (#473 on
 * `hornjason/pai-config`, tuned there in #474, reworked in #1120).
 *
 * Extracted from the hook so the population it refuses can be MEASURED
 * rather than argued about: 5,060 real commands from this machine's
 * transcripts were run through it, which is not something you can do with a
 * decision that only exists inside a subprocess. Same shape as
 * `lib/gate-result-protection.ts`, which #1137 extracted for the same reason.
 *
 * ## The thing this module exists to get right
 *
 * One mechanism was failing in BOTH directions at once.
 *
 * It UNDER-blocked, because a read-only prefix allowlist was consulted before
 * anything looked at what the command wrote, so `gh --version; echo x >
 * .gate-salt` exited clean. A prefix says nothing about what follows a `;`.
 *
 * It OVER-blocked, because the remaining checks matched protected names
 * anywhere in the command STRING, so a read-only `git show … | grep -nE
 * "chmod|chflags"` was refused for quoting the words it was searching for.
 * That happened four times in real work — twice to the session coordinating
 * this fix, twice to a peer staging a comparison copy — and a guard that
 * makes reading its own source awkward is a guard people route around.
 *
 * Both directions are the same root cause: a substring test over a whole
 * command line cannot tell CODE from DATA. So nothing here tests the whole
 * string. The command is split into segments at top-level separators, and
 * each check asks a structural question of a segment:
 *
 *   - what does this segment WRITE?          → redirects, tee, cp/mv
 *   - what does this segment MUTATE in place? → sed -i, dd of=, rm, …
 *   - is this segment OPAQUE?                 → an interpreter body, find -exec
 *   - is this segment's COMMAND WORD chmod?   → not "does it contain chmod"
 *
 * Quotes are handled two different ways on purpose, and the distinction is
 * the whole fix:
 *
 *   `stripQuoted`  deletes quoted spans INCLUDING their contents. Used to
 *                  find a VERB, because text inside quotes is an argument,
 *                  never the command the shell runs. This is what stops a
 *                  grep PATTERN from reading as a chmod invocation.
 *   `dequote`      removes quote characters and KEEPS the contents. Used to
 *                  find a TARGET, because `chmod 777 "x.hook.ts"` really does
 *                  name a hook file.
 *
 * Using `stripQuoted` for both would let an attacker quote the path; using
 * `dequote` for both reinstates all four false positives. Each test below
 * names which one it uses and why.

    //    it. The prose case is now separated by POSITION instead: the command
    //    word must BE `security`, which an issue comment's `gh` never is.
    //    #1184: the key is matched across the WHOLE command, not just this
    //    segment, so `KEY=pai-gate-salt; security … -s "$KEY"` cannot hide it
    //    behind a variable. Measured cost: 0 commands in an unfiltered corpus
    //    of 125,644. The command word must still BE `security`, which is what
    //    keeps the `gh issue comment` prose case allowed.
    //
    //    The other half of that suggestion — firing on any keychain
    //    SUBCOMMAND whether or not the key is named — is refused. In the same
    //    corpus only TWO commands have `security` as their command word, and
    //    widening to subcommands newly blocks exactly one: `security
    //    find-generic-password -h`, a help invocation. One false positive,
    //    zero true positives, no evidence of the risk it was meant to cover.
