# Project State

**Current phase: Scaffold Decomposition — 9 SCs open**

Session 15 — 6-agent refactor shipped, pipeline forensics, council audit.

6-agent refactor: ship.js committed with batched agents, 7 spec-compliance tests fixed.
Pipeline run #595: 19 agents, 14 min, SHIPPED. All 3 ACs PASS. Marcus 9/12 compliance (75%).
Root cause analysis: 21% first-attempt ship pass rate across 16 issues. 78% of failures are 1 test.
  - Evidence commands with absolute paths override EVIDENCE_CWD in worktrees
  - Ceremony fields not pre-populated before ship gate
  - 16/19 agents are bash wrappers (Workflow API lacks exec())
New: lib/canary.ts (13 tests), B2 operator fix (contains/exists/!=/< added), AES prompt reinforcement.
Council v2 running with full forensic data (10 runs, 37 gate attempts, agent-level transcripts).

Suite: 1376 pass, 0 fail, 77 files. 4/25 SCs done. 6 issues shipped: #590, #592, #584, #594, #595.

**Next priorities:**
1. P0: Fix 21% first-attempt pass rate — evidence-path worktree mismatch + ceremony field gaps (council in progress)
2. P0: Reduce XS pipeline from 19 agents / 14 min to <6 agents / <5 min
3. P1: Close AES gap — COMP-6 (dup reads) leaks through prompt reinforcement, needs mechanical enforcement
4. P1: #593 Fast path for XS issues
5. P1: Integrate canary module into brief assembler + transcript checker
6. P2: Navigability scoring (SC-236/237 still test.todo)
7. P3: Scaffold Decomposition, Hook Architecture, Gate Contracts

**Session 2026-09-26 session 15:**
- 6-agent refactor shipped: batched agents, 7 spec-compliance tests fixed, undefined alreadyVerdict bug fixed
- Pipeline run #595: 19 agents, 14 min, SHIPPED. All 3 ACs PASS. Marcus 9/12 compliance (75%)
- Root cause analysis: 21% first-attempt pass rate. Evidence-path worktree mismatch + ceremony gaps
- Canary testing module: lib/canary.ts + 13 tests (generateCanaryPhrase, plantCanaries, checkCanaries)
- B2 evidence validator: added missing contains/exists/!=/< operators + NaN guards
- AES prompt reinforcement: COMP-6/COMP-12 in Marcus prompt (still leaks — needs mechanical enforcement)
- Council v2 launched with full forensic data: 10 runs, 37 gate attempts, agent-level transcripts

**Session 2026-09-25 session 14:**
- AES hill-climb: 32→87 in 3 dry-run iterations (TDD top, context injection, efficiency rules)
- Pipeline optimization: 32 agents/141 min → 16 agents/20 min
- Prove regression eliminated: LIGHT skips prove, no re-implementation loop
- Agent batching: init+prior-branch, ac-prevalidation+prior-branch, brief-preflight+assemble, commit+env-check+record, merge+push, finalize (4→1)
- Grading aligned to COMP-1 through COMP-13 with verdict + evidence
- Context injection working: COMP-1/COMP-5/COMP-11 pass via prompt injection
- Verify gate cwd fixed (EVIDENCE_CWD), merge guard added
- bun test --parallel --no-isolate (209→176s), redundant test runs eliminated
- 5 issues shipped: #590 (40%), #592 (70%), #584 (67%), #594 (83%), #595 (83%)
- Ship gate false positives: B1/B2/evidence-type-ratio checks fire on LIGHT (should be exempt)
- Deep adversarial audit: 26/32 agents were bash wrappers, prove was 42% of runtime

**Session 2026-09-24 session 13:**
- Ship-and-heal dogfood: #585 shipped (HEALED), #591 shipped (HEALED)
- Grading pipeline shipped: transcript path fix, role filtering, remediation flow
- Violation categorization: quality vs process (SC-465-468)
- analyze-transcript.ts: file efficiency, deliverable ratio, test runs, context growth
