description: A check is only worth what it fails on — prove a guard can go red before trusting it green
---

## The rule

Before you trust a check, prove it fails. Break the thing it guards — by hand,
in a scratch edit you throw away — and watch it go red. If it stays green, you
do not have a check, you have a line in a report.

Do this for anything whose job is to catch a problem: a test, a gate, a lint
rule, a ratchet, a CI step.

## Why

This is the single most common defect in this codebase's own tooling. Not a
hypothetical — a count. On 2026-10-06, five of eight issues shipped in one day
were the same bug wearing different clothes: **a check that passed because of
what it never looked at.**

- A prompt-immutability gate ran `ls -lO` and grepped for a BSD flag. On Linux
  CI the command fails, nothing is appended to the violations list, and the
  check passes unconditionally. It had never once run in CI.
- A guard against top-level `require()` stripped template literals with a
  regex. Backticks inside comments and strings paired with unrelated ones and
  deleted 61% of the file, including the two functions the guard existed to
  protect. Two new violations were added and the suite reported 48 pass.
- A budget counter read `parseInt(raw) || 0`. One unparseable byte silently
  meant "zero spent", disabling the cap while every message still looked normal.
- Nine `require()` calls inside `try/catch` in an environment with no module
  loading. Every one threw, every throw was swallowed as a warning, and the run
  reported success with its measurement features switched off.
- A "generator determinism" test called a one-argument function with three
  arguments, compared two arrays that were always empty, and `expect([])
  .toEqual([])` passed no matter how non-deterministic the generator was.

Every one of those was green. Every one was green for a reason that had nothing
to do with the code being correct.

## What makes this hard to notice

A failing check announces itself. A check that cannot fail looks exactly like a
check that is satisfied — and it looks *better* over time, because it never
flakes and never blocks anyone. The quieter it is, the more it is trusted.

Three shapes to watch for, all taken from the list above:

- **Fail-open error handling.** A `catch` that returns "no problems found", or
  a parse failure that defaults to an empty violation list. Anything that can
  throw inside a fail-open guard is a guard bypass; the fail-open is not the
  bug, it is the amplifier.
- **A detector narrower than what it detects.** Text matching that a reformat,
  a line break or a different platform defeats. If the guard's view of the
  input can silently shrink, assert on the view itself.
- **Assertions that hold vacuously.** Comparing two empty collections, matching
  a pattern against text that was stripped out upstream, asserting a value the
  test itself just set.

## In practice

When you add or change a guard, say in the commit or PR **what you broke to
make it fail**. One line is enough: "removing the slice makes it compare the
run against itself, which this now catches." That sentence is cheap to write,
and it is the only evidence that separates a real check from a decorative one.

When a guard has to ship red — a known-violations ratchet — bank progress in
the same commit that earns it, and write down what the number means. A ratchet
nobody can interpret becomes a number nobody lowers.

## For a script whose job is to exit non-zero

A sentence in the PR is evidence a reader has to trust. When the guard is a
script, the break can live in the test instead, and then it is re-checked on
every run.

Route every refusal through **one exported exit-code constant**, declared on a
single line, and have the test build a mutant copy of the source with that
constant set to `0`. Each negative case then runs twice — the real script, and
the mutant — and asserts the real one refuses while the mutant does not. The
second assertion is the whole point: it is the removal of the non-zero exit,
performed and observed, so a case that later starts passing for an unrelated
reason stops being indistinguishable from a case that is genuinely caught.

`scripts/rook-review-scope.ts` and `test/rook-review-scope.test.ts` are the
worked example (#129). Two properties make it work, and both are asserted by
the test rather than left as conventions:

- The constant appears exactly once in the source, so no refusal can quietly
  bypass the mutation by inlining `process.exit(1)`.
- The script has no relative imports, so the mutant runs from a temp
  directory. Without that check a later `from "../lib/..."` would make every
  mutant die on module resolution — exiting non-zero, which reads as the
  mutation having been rejected on the merits.

What was broken to prove it: setting the constant to `0` turns all eleven
negative tests red, and separately, making the empty-scope branch return `[]`
instead of throwing turns the four SC-568 tests red. Neither mutation is left
in the tree; both were run and reverted.
