# Regression Test Requirements

## Purpose
Every fix must include a test that would have caught the bug.

## When to use
After implementing a fix — before marking AC complete.

## Template

### Requirements
1. Test reproduces the original bug (fails without the fix)
2. Test passes with the fix applied
3. Test covers the root cause, not just the symptom
4. Test is named descriptively: "should [expected] when [condition]"

### Gate enforcement
- Test count post >= test count pre — decrease = FAIL
- Zero test removals without explicit rationale
