/**
 * Covers #1120 — `lib/bash-write-guard.ts`.
 *
 * Two populations, and the second is the point. Witnesses prove the guard
 * refuses a write; CONTROLS prove it does not refuse everything, because a
 * check that refuses everything passes every witness ever written for it.
 *
 * The controls are not invented. F1-F4 are REAL commands from real work that
 * the old guard refused:
 *
 *   F1, F2  the session coordinating #1120, twice, trying to read this very
 *           file with `git show … | grep -nE "chmod|chflags"`
 *   F3      a peer staging a comparison copy of a hook under /tmp
 *   F4      `hornjason/pai-config#474` — the ONLY false positive ever
 *           recorded for this hook, recovered verbatim from the 2026-09-10
 *           transcript
 *
 * F5-F8 come from a sweep of 5,060 real commands extracted from this
 * machine's 35,040 transcripts — every Bash command ever run here that names
 * a protected artifact. F5's shape alone occurs 1,390 times.
